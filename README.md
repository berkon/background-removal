# background-removal

This repo is just intended for reproduction of a freeze issue (see details here https://github.com/google/mediapipe/issues/2808), but of course can also be used for other purposes. It is based on this demo [https://codepen.io/mediapipe/full/wvJyQpq](https://codepen.io/mediapipe/full/wvJyQpq) of the MediaPipe - Selfie Segmentation demo.
